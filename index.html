      <h1>Angular JS</h1>
      <p>
        Angular is a popular front-end framework used for building single-page
        applications (SPAs) with dynamic content. Developed by Google, Angular
        provides a robust set of tools for creating web apps, including
        two-way data binding, a modular architecture, and dependency
        injection. Angular is designed to make development easier and more
        efficient by providing a unified framework that handles both the
        structure and behavior of the application. It also features powerful
        routing and form management tools, and it works seamlessly with
        RESTful APIs to retrieve and manipulate data.
      </p>

    <section id="NextJS">
      <h1>Next JS</h1>
      <p>
        Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building server-side
        rendered (SSR) web applications. It enables automatic static
        optimization, server-side rendering, and fast page transitions. With
        Next.js, developers can build scalable and SEO-friendly web apps by
        leveraging features such as pre-rendering, dynamic imports, and API
        routes. It also simplifies the configuration of React applications,
        making it an excellent choice for developers looking to create fast
        and efficient websites with minimal setup.
      </p>

    <section id="Gatsby">
      <h1>Gatsby</h1>
      <p>
        Gatsby is a modern static site generator built with React. It allows
        developers to build fast and optimized websites by pre-rendering pages
        at build time. Gatsbyâ€™s key features include data integration from
        multiple sources, automated image optimization, and support for
        progressive web apps (PWAs). By generating static files for your
        website, Gatsby improves performance and SEO. It also has a vibrant
        plugin ecosystem, allowing you to integrate with various data sources
        like CMSs, APIs, and markdown files, making it an excellent choice for
        building content-heavy websites.
      </p>

    <section id="ExpressJS">
      <h1>Express JS</h1>
      <p>
        Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
        that simplifies server-side development. It provides a robust set of
        features to handle HTTP requests, middleware, routing, and templating
        engines. Express allows developers to create APIs and dynamic web
        applications with ease, making it one of the most widely used
        frameworks for Node.js. Its simplicity and flexibility make it a go-to
        choice for building RESTful APIs, handling file uploads, and managing
        middleware in complex applications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Svelte">
      <h1>Svelte</h1>
      <p>
        Svelte is a relatively new front-end framework that has gained
        popularity due to its unique approach to building user interfaces.
        Unlike other frameworks like React and Vue, Svelte shifts much of the
        work to compile time rather than running a virtual DOM in the browser.
        This results in faster performance and smaller bundles. Svelte is
        known for its simplicity and ease of use, allowing developers to
        create interactive web applications with minimal boilerplate. Its
        reactive syntax and component-based structure make it an attractive
        choice for modern web development.
